# Yutub

## Introduction

Yutub is my first full-stack web development project, and I have been working on it for a couple of months.

The frontend design is inspired by the YouTube website. While the current version does not include animations or transitions, I plan to incorporate these elements in the upcoming version.

The backend of Yutub is based on the YT backend learning series by Channel Chai aur Code, taught by Hitesh Chaudhary. I have made some upgrades and added additional functions to enhance its capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Mongoose, Multer
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Full-Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
- **Authentication:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Development Phases

### Version 1 (V1)

This version focuses on core functionality. I did not prioritize optimization during this phase, as it was my very first significant project. V1 includes shaping the UI, handling API interactions, and ensuring basic responsiveness.

### Version 2 (V2)

 In this version, I aim to enhance the user experience by improving smoothness and optimization. I will also focus on cleaning up the code and achieving complete responsiveness across devices.

### Version 3 (V3)

This final version will introduce new and exciting features, further enriching the overall experience for users.
