## Introduction

Yutub is my first full-stack web development project, and I have been working on it for a couple of months.

The frontend design is inspired by the YouTube website. While the current version does not include animations or transitions, I plan to incorporate these elements in the upcoming version.

The backend of Yutub is based on the YT backend learning series by Channel Chai aur Code, taught by Hitesh Chaudhary. I have made some upgrades and added additional functions to enhance its capabilities.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend:** React, Axios
- **Backend:** Node.js, Mongoose, Multer
- **Cloud Storage:** Cloudinary
- **Full-Stack:** MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)
